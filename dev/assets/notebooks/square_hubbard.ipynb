    "# Tutorial 1: Square Lattice Hubbard Model DQMC Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial implements a determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulation from \"scratch\"\n",
    "using the [`JDQMCFramework.jl`](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/JDQMCFramework.jl.git) package, along with several others.\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to empower researchers to write their own lightweight DQMC codes\n",
    "in order to address specific research needs that fall outside the scope of existing high-level\n",
    "DQMC packages like [`SmoQyDQMC.jl`](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl.git), and to enable\n",
    "rapid prototyping of algorithmic improvements to existing DQMC methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is relatively long as a lot goes into writing a full DQMC code.\n",
    "However, in spite of the length, each step is relatively straightforward.\n",
    "This is made possible by leveraging the functionality exported by\n",
    "[`JDQMCFramework.jl`](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/JDQMCFramework.jl.git) and other packages.\n",
    "For instance, the [`JDQMCFramework.jl`](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/JDQMCFramework.jl.git) package takes care of all the\n",
    "numerical stabilization nonsense that is one of the most challenging parts of writing a DQMC code.\n",
    "Also, implementing various correlation measurements in a DQMC simulation is typically very time consuming and challening,\n",
    "as it requires working through arduous Wick's contractions, and then implementing each term.\n",
    "Once again, this hurdle is largely avoided by leveraging the functionality exported by the\n",
    "[`JDQMCMeasurements.jl`](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/JDQMCMeasurements.jl.git) package,\n",
    "which implements a variety of standard correlation function measurements for arbitary lattice geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The repulsive Hubbard model Hamiltonian on a square lattice considered in this tutorial is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{H} = -t \\sum_{\\sigma,\\langle i,j\\rangle} (\\hat{c}^{\\dagger}_{\\sigma,i} \\hat{c}^{\\phantom \\dagger}_{\\sigma,j} + {\\rm h.c.})\n",
    "  + U \\sum_i (\\hat{n}_{\\uparrow,i}-\\tfrac{1}{2})(\\hat{n}_{\\downarrow,i}-\\tfrac{1}{2}) - \\mu \\sum_{\\sigma,i} \\hat{n}_{\\sigma,i},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\hat{c}^\\dagger_{\\sigma,i} (\\hat{c}^{\\phantom \\dagger}_{\\sigma,i})$ creates (annihilates) a spin $\\sigma$\n",
    "electron on site $i$ in the lattice, and $\\hat{n}_{\\sigma,i} = \\hat{c}^\\dagger_{\\sigma,i} \\hat{c}^{\\phantom \\dagger}_{\\sigma,i}$\n",
    "is the spin-$\\sigma$ electron number operator for site $i$. In the above Hamiltonian, $t$ is the nearest neighbor hopping integral,\n",
    "$\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $U > 0$ controls the strength of the on-site Hubbard repulsion.\n",
    "Lastly, if $\\mu = 0.0,$ then the Hamiltonian is particle-hole symmetric, ensuring the system is half-filled $(\\langle n_\\sigma \\rangle = \\tfrac{1}{2})$\n",
    "and that there is no sign problem. In the case of $\\mu \\ne 0$ there will be a sign problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script version of this tutorial, which can be downloaded using the link found at the top of this page,\n",
    "can be run with the command\n",
    "```\n",
    "julia square_hubbard.jl\n",
    "```\n",
    "in a terminal. This tutorial can also be downloaded as a notebook at the top of this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing the relevant packages we will need to use in this example.\n",
    "Note that to run this tutorial you will need to install all the required Julia packages.\n",

    "with the Julia [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git)\n",
    "package registry. This means they can all be easily installed with the Julia package manager\n",
